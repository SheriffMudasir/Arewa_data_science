# Arewa Data Science Phase Two

Welcome to the Phase Two repository of my training in data science and machine learning @Arewa Data Science and Machine learning Academy! This phase is dedicated to advancing my understanding and skills in data science with a focus on practical applications using Python. I will delve into powerful libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, among others, to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data.

## Objective

The main objective of this phase is to equip me with the necessary tools and knowledge to tackle real-world data science problems. By the end of this phase, i will be comfortable with data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, and ready to apply these skills in various data science projects.

## What Will I Learn

- **Numpy:** Learn how to perform mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
- **Pandas:** Explore data structures and data analysis tools for cleaning and processing data.
- **Matplotlib:** Visualize data using plots and charts to gain insights.
- Additional topics may include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and introduction to machine learning concepts.
